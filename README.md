# Woo Sample Data
This is a set of sample data for WooCommerce designed for test your themes or plugins. Based off the default [WooCommerce Core sample data](https://woocommerce.com/document/importing-woocommerce-sample-data/), it includes data with the addition of incomplete, incorrect or malformed products. The issues with products are some of those observed while working with clients migrating from different eCommerce solutions, and are designed to help make sure your theme or plugin can account for these problems. 

The product data is broken into groups and tags, as well as separate files to allow you to add the good or bad data.

Note that the bad data are duplicate fo the original data with intentional issues added, and the product images are pulled from the same location as the WooCommerce Core sample data.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The original sample data in WooComemrce Core is included with the addition of the "Sample Data", and "Good Sample" tags to help differentiate and sort them.

The other sample data added has been created with incomplete, incorrect or malformed products data and "Sample Data", and "Bad Sample" tags added.

The "Sample Data" tag is there to quickly identify any and all sample data that may have been added to an site with existing product data so it may be easily filtered and removed.

The "Good Sample" and "Bad Sample" tags are their to differential the original WooComemrce Core sample data from the sample data with know issues.

All products with problems have a brief mention of their general issue they have added to their name and SKU.
